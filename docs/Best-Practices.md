This quick start will require minimal time, but it will give you a good idea of how to apply the most important Docs style concepts when writing tutorials on GitHub. These guidelines apply whether you are creating new documentation or updating existing Xilinx documentation.

# Style & Tone

* Check the spelling and grammar in your tutorials, even if you have to copy and paste into Word to do it.
* Use a casual and friendly voice--like you're talking to another person one-on-one.
* Use simple sentences. They are easier to understand, and they are more easily translated by both human and machine translators.
* Focus on the intent. Clearly determine what task to do. 
* Use consistent wording and trademarks. Trademarks are important especially on GitHub as we do not ship Legal disclaimers with each tutorial.
* Don't break up steps with commentary or asides.
* For steps that include code snippets, put additional information about the step into the code as comments. This reduces the amount of text that people have to read through. The key information gets copied into the code project to remind people of what the code is doing when they refer to it later.
* Use sentence case for all titles and headings.


# README
Your first steps in documentation should go into your README.  It is the first interaction that most users will have with your project. So having a solid README will serve your project well. 

- [ ] To add a reference to a README template.

# Things to remember
- A lot of people will come to your docs trying to figure out what exactly your project is. You should explain what your project does and why it exists. 
- Provide example(s) of what your project would normally be used for. 
- People like to browse the code sometimes. They might be interested in filing bugs against the code for issues they’ve found. Make it really easy for people who want to contribute back to the project in any way possible. 
- Document how to get help and interact with the community around a project.
- People usually have standards for how they expect things to be done in their projects. You should document these so that if people write code, they can do things in the norm of the project. A great way to do that is to include a Contributing section which outlines how to get started with the project as a developer, and all the steps necessary to get code successfully merged into the project.

  ℹ️ You can also use **Contributing.md** file for this purpose. GitHub recognizes this file and provides link to this file from various pages that a contributor may access.

- Pick a standard license (BSD/ MIT/ GPL). Contact your manager or legal team for more details.
